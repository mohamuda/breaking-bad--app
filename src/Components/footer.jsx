          This website was fanmade and created to be a fan made breaking bad
          Wiki. The project's goal was to use the breaking bad API to
          dynamically search and render information with Vanilla Javascript and
          React with a simplistic style in mind. This was simply just a fun
          project to work on and test out my skills.
